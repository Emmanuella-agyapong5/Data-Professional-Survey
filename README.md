## Objectives
The main goals of this project were to:
- Analyze the demographic distribution of survey respondents.  
- Examine average salaries across job titles.  
- Identify favorite programming languages among data professionals.  
- Assess happiness with salary and work-life balance.  
- Understand how difficult it was for respondents to break into data roles.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
All data transformations were performed in Power Query before building the visuals.  
Below are the key steps taken to prepare the dataset:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary and duplicate columns.  
- Standardized text cases and corrected inconsistent entries.  
- Handled missing or null values where necessary.  

### 2. Column Refinement
- Cleaned categorical variables such as:
  - *Favorite Programming Language*  
  - *Industry Worked In*  
  - *Country of Residence*  
  - *Current Job Title*  
- Removed “Other” entries where respondents provided custom text responses to ensure uniformity.

### 3. Data Transformation
- Calculated average salary by job title.  
- Created new measures including:
  - Average age of survey takers  
  - Average salary of survey takers

### Average Salary by Job Title
Compares average salaries across different data-related roles such as:
- Data Scientist  
- Data Engineer  
- Data Analyst  
- Database Developer  
- Data Architect  

### Favorite Programming Language
Shows the most popular programming languages among respondents.

### Difficulty to Break into Data
Visualizes how respondents rated their journey into data roles — from *very difficult* to *very easy*.

### Happiness Metrics
Two key gauges display:
- **Happiness with Work-life Balance**  
- **Happiness with Salary**

### Summary Cards
- **Total Number of Survey Takers:** 630
